# Computational Thinking
________________________
--------------------------


##Computational Thinking of four key areas
* #### Problem decomposition
    - Breaking problems into smaller parts that are easier to solve
* #### Pattern Matching
    - Finding similarities between factors to obtain specific information
* #### Abstract painting
    - Ignoring special details to create solutions that apply to common problems
* #### Algorithm = Automation
    - Controlling the process using automation to minimize human intervention

---------------------------------------------------

## Elements of computers in the modern sense
* #### Calculation function
* #### Electronic
* #### Digital
* #### Stored program concept

Computers are a **tool for performing calculations**, and computers in a modern sense have concepts of **electronic, digital, and stored program concept** in addition to computation.

```
Many activities in modern society are increasingly dependent on computers, and computers are doing human activities on behalf of humans. The use of computers, or the way of thinking using computing, is essential!!

## Benefits of Social Computing Education
* #### Demonstrate effective methods for the Coast Guard in question
* #### Develop active utilization of computers
* #### Identify which parts of the problem can be solved by a computer
* #### Apply different algorithms to troubleshooting



> Computer science is not computer programming. Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstaction. -Jeannett M. Wing
